# Convolution From Scratch

This repository contains Python code for implementing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) from scratch, including the creation of a convolution layer, implementation of popular convolutional networks such as LeNet-5, and additional functionalities related to convolution operations.

## Features

- **Convolution Layer Implementation**: We provide a detailed implementation of a convolutional layer from scratch, including forward and backward propagation.
- **Convolutional Networks**: This repository includes implementations of various convolutional networks, including but not limited to LeNet-5, AlexNet, VGG, and ResNet, demonstrating how these networks can be built using basic convolutional layers.
- **Extensive Documentation**: Each component of the implementation is extensively documented to provide insights into the workings of convolutional neural networks.
- **Modular Design**: The code is structured in a modular fashion, making it easy to understand, modify, and extend for experimentation with different architectures and hyperparameters.
- **Educational Resource**: This repository serves as an educational resource for understanding the fundamentals of convolutional neural networks by implementing them from scratch.
